<h2><b>Social Media Clone with C++ and Data Structures & Algorithms</b></h2>

<h3><b>Overview</b></h3>
This project is a social media clone built using C++ and incorporates various Data Structures and Algorithms to manage user data efficiently. The goal is to provide a basic yet functional platform for users to connect, share posts, and interact with each other.
<br></br>
<h3><b>Features</b></h3>
User Registration and Authentication: Users can register with the system, and their credentials are securely stored. Authentication ensures that only registered users can access the system.

<h3><b>Profile Management</b></h3> Users can create, update, and delete their profiles. Profile information includes user details, posts, friends, etc.

<h3> <b>Post Creation and Interaction</b> </h3> Users can create posts, like posts, and comment on posts. The system utilizes data structures to efficiently manage posts and their interactions.

Friendship Management: Users can send friend requests, accept or reject requests, and manage their list of friends. Friend-related operations are optimized using data structures.

<h3><b>Implementation</b></h3>
The project is implemented in C++ and incorporates various Data Structures and Algorithms such as linked lists, hash tables, and sorting algorithms for efficient data management.
